        "This is your second practical project which will require reviewing. A new thing introduced in this project is that it will require 2 corrections and both of them will be performed by peers. Later in the course, most sprints will have 1 STL and 1 peer corrections. \n",
        "\n",
        "If there's both a peer and an STL correction for the same sprint, peer reviews have a much smaller weight compared to STLs when calculating the final score of a project (the passing score is 70% or more) — so as a learner you should not worry about being extremely objective.\n",
        "\n",
        "When booking a peer correction, you might get an STL if there are no learners available. However, the same STL can never perform both corrections for the same learner for the same sprint.\n",

        "To become available to review others yourself, you should click on the \"My Availability\" button in the top left corner of the Turing platform. By doing these corrections, you will receive correction points which you will need to receive further peer corrections yourself. Correction points are used every time you book a peer review. You should set your availability once you complete this project, as you will then be able to start reviewing other learners who still need to complete this project.\n",

Make sure that you set the sharing permissions of your Google Spreadsheet so that anyone with the link can view it. If you are working on an Excel file, upload it the the repository as a file similarly how you did in the previous sprint. However, note that if your reviewer does not use Excel, they might see some of the formatting differently if they open the file on Google Sheets.\n",

A reviewer, if they see an empty repository with no solution, is allowed to cancel the review. \n",

        "After your first project review, you are encouraged to use the feedback received to make changes and improve your project. If you make the changes very close to the time of the second review, inform the reviewer at the start of the call that you have made some changes. Reviewers usually check your work in advance and might have only seen a previous version. To avoid this, you can schedule your two reviews with some time in-between and make the updates as early as possible.\n",
